# DS5500 HW1
# Problem 1
Take the Gapminder Test: <http://forms.gapminder.org/s3/test-2018>
## What score did you received? Did any of the answers surprise you?
I got right only 3 out of the 13 questions.  
Many of the questions surprises me. If I have to pick one I will choose the ratio of 1-year-old children that are vaccinated. It seems the world a put a lot of effort to prevent the spread of preventable diseases.
## Choose a question from the test, re-state it, and answer it using visualization and summarization. Provide a figure and any relevant output with your answer.

# Problem 2
Visualize the distribution of income (GDP / capita) across countries and continents, and how the distributionof income changes over time.
- Distribution of Income across countries
![Country](output/gdp_country.gif)
- Distribution of Income across continents
![Continent](output/gdp_continent.gif)
## Interpret the visualization and what you notice. Are they any notable trends and/or deviations from that trend?
## What caveats apply to your conclusions?

# Problem 3
Use visualization to investigate the relationship between income (GDP / capita), life expectancy, and child mortality over time.
## How does each measure change over time within each continent?
## Interpret your visualizations, noting any trends and/or outliers.

# Problem 4
## Choose two variables you have not investigated yet, and visualize their distributions, their relationship with each other, and how these change over time.
## Interpret your visualizations, noting any trends and/or outliers.

# Problem 5
## Did you use static or interactive plots to answer the previous problems?
## Explore the data using the interactive visualization tools at <https://www.gapminder.org/tools>, and watch the TED talk “The best stats you’ve ever seen” at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w>.
## Discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and relative usefulness of using interactive/dynamic visualizations versus static visualizations.
