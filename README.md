## Interpret your visualizations, noting any trends and/or outliers.

# Problem 5
## Did you use static or interactive plots to answer the previous problems?
## Explore the data using the interactive visualization tools at <https://www.gapminder.org/tools>, and watchthe TED talk “The best stats you’ve ever seen” at <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVimVzgtD6w>.
## Discuss the advantages, disadvantages, and relative usefulness of using interactive/dynamic visualizationsversus static visualizations.
